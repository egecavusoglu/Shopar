Creative Portion:

1. I have added a cart mechanism to the app so when the user calculates details for a single unit, they add it to the cart and calculate for new products. They can also see the sum of the cart and Reset the cart (10 points)

2. I have used 2 buttons to get the User Input and some standart UI design to display the new information. The calculation is implemented in separate Swift functions.

3. This will be useful if the user is in a shopping mall and buying multiple products because they will be able to keep track of their total spending.
